            <p>I am a hard working professional living in the Portland area. I am originally from Phoenix have been working in the IT field for nearly a decade, and am excited to make the switch over to programming. I originally studied computer science at Arizona State but did not complete my degree and switched to an IT career.
            </p>
            <p>After working my way up from <span class="job-titles">Junior IT Technician</span> to <span class="job-titles">Network and Systems Administrator</span>, I found myself with the opportunity to travel the world. Over the course of April 2016 to April 2018, I travelled to over 40 different countries, seeing sites such as the Great Wall of China, The Great Ocean Road, and Victoria Falls.</p>
            <p>My travels eventually lead me to a job working as a <span class="job-titles">Help Desk Specialist</span> at a ski resort in Australia. Once the season was over, I returned back to Phoenix to work temporarily again for my former company as an <span class="job-titles">IT Contractor</span>.</p>
